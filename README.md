# Pong_Clone
This is a recreation of the classic video game Pong done in C++ and Allegro 5 Visual Library


This repository contains all the necessary classes, audio files, and font files necessary for the Pong game to run.

Note: This will only work on Linux systems with Allegro 5 libraries installed, to make this work in windows is quite a bit more complicated, and our group chose not to adapt it to work on windows.

Feel free to browse the code!
